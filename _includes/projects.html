    <h3> Social Spam Campaings' Identification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> AN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS' SPAM RESEARCH PROJECT</li>
      <li> The scope of this project is limited to the prevailing online social media platforms such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr. These platforms make up for a huge part of the spam being generated by spammers online.</li>
      <!-- <li> Yet to implement the main functionality and deploy it on AWS</li> -->

    </ul>
    <p>The internet has changed our lives in ways unprecedented, social media being the biggest one of them. However, with the facilities social media provides, it is also a spammerâ€™s dream. People have misused these online social platforms to promulgate spam across the borders limiting their countries. This is a research-based project which aims at identifying the spam campaigns and their intensity on the social media. </p>

    <h3> Optimizing Machine Learning Models using
Multiobjective Grasshopper Optimization
Algorithm
 </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Feature Selection Performed Using:MATLAB</li>
      <li> Model Accuracy Compared Using: Python and SciKit</li>
      <li> Yet to implement the main functionality and deploy it on AWS</li>

    </ul>
    <p>. Multiobjective Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm is a recent meta-heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm developed by Mirjalili
at. El. It is inspired from the movement of grasshopper swarms in nature.
It can be applied in numerous domains due to its impressive characteristics like easy to use, scalable, flexible and better performance than classic
methods in real problems. In the paper, MOGOA, which is a population
based method has been used for feature selection. </p>

    <h3> LSTM Forex Predictor </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Based on Keras and Long Short Term Memory Models</li>
      <li> Predicts the the forex rates for EUR to JPY</li>
      <li> Works like time series prediction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a Machine Learning Project which is uploaded as an ipython notebook with detailed explanation regarding data preprocessing. The model's backend is based on Keras running on Tensorflow backend. </p>

    <h3> News Delivery Twitter Bot (DEPRECIATED) </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> This bot was made on Twitter's STREAM api (when it was working :'(  )</li>
      
      <li> This bot was not made smart due to the lack of resources and data, it worked on string matching.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Made it as a project for my first internship at a News Company, where the bot would interact with users and deliver news to them by making a query on our DB. I will soon be revamping the bot to the Twitter's new API </p>
