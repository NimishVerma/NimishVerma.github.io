    <h3> Social Spam Campaings' Identification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> AN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS' SPAM RESEARCH PROJECT</li>
      <li> The scope of this project is limited to the prevailing online social media platforms such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr. These platforms make up for a huge part of the spam being generated by spammers online.</li>
      <!-- <li> Yet to implement the main functionality and deploy it on AWS</li> -->

    </ul>
    <p>The internet has changed our lives in ways unprecedented, social media being the biggest one of them. However, with the facilities social media provides, it is also a spammerâ€™s dream. People have misused these online social platforms to promulgate spam across the borders limiting their countries. This is a research-based project which aims at identifying the spam campaigns and their intensity on the social media. </p>

    <p>This site helps you to store photos of your friends/family in an organized manner. You make seperate profiles of each person and just tag one or more than one of them on the photos you upload. On their birthday/anniversary or any special day, you get a reminder and a collage/video made. Plus you can access all of these photos in one page so that you can post them on other social media websites like Facebook.</p>

    <h3> News Delivery Twitter Bot (DEPRECIATED) </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> This bot was made on Twitter's STREAM api (when it was working :'(  )</li>
      
      <li> This bot was not made smart due to the lack of resources and data, it worked on string matching.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Made it as a project for my first internship at a News Company, where the bot would interact with users and deliver news to them by making a query on our DB. I will soon be revamping the bot to the Twitter's new API </p>
